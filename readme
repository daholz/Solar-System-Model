Update 3/2/2021: Added index.html and style.css. Currently shows an animated model of the solar system, made with CSS. 
There's room to add information on the various celestial bodies later. Eventually I want to add the ability to have information 
show up on the left side of the screen when an object is clicked on/rolled over.
